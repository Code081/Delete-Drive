# Delete Google Drive Files by Date and Type
This project provides a script that allows you to easily delete Google Drive files of a particular date and type in bulk with just one run. 

## Motivation
I created this script after accidentally uploading millions of dataset photos to my Google Drive while working on a Google Colab project. Google One support was not helpful, and I couldn't find any other way to delete files in bulk without paying. This script helped me efficiently delete those files without the need for manual deletion.

## Features
- Delete Google Drive files based on a specific date and file type.
- Bulk deletion with just one run of the script.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.md` file.
4. Create a Google Cloud account and enable the Google Drive API.
5. Generate the credentials to be used in the script.
6. Configure the script with your Google Drive credentials.
7. Specify the date and file type for deletion.
8. Run the script and watch as it deletes the specified files.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Please note that this script is provided as-is and should be used with caution. Make sure to double-check the files you are deleting before running the script.
